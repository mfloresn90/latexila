Release 3.18.1, 2015-11-08
--------------------------
* After some GTK+ changes during the last few releases, there were some
  regressions in LaTeXila. Because of the overlay scrollbars, it was not
  possible to select some characters with the mouse. And when (1) line numbers
  are not displayed and (2) the side panel is visible, it is not possible to
  move the cursor before the first character of a line (with the mouse),
  because at that region of the screen the mouse permits to change the size of
  the side panel…
  So to avoid those regressions:
	* Overlay scrolling is disabled at some places
	* Line numbers are now displayed by default

* Added Portuguese translation
* Added Ukrainian help translation

* Add default spell checking settings in the preferences dialog.
* Via the Tools menu, the spell checking settings can be changed and are stored
  on a file-by-file basis.
* There is now a spell checker dialog window, to spell check an entire file
  word-by-word. (the “inline” spell checker is still present, where misspelled
  words are highlighted with a red wavy underline).
* Ensure that the personal build tools and the templates are correctly saved.
* Other various small improvements and bug fixes
* Translation updates
